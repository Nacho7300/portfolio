    <h3 class="strengths">Competing</h3>
    <p>I feel great joy when I win. I truly hate to lose because I am always striving for first place. Every day I compete. Winning first place is my goal in any contest that I feel is worth my time. If there is no one to compete against, I compete against myself to do more or accomplish a goal faster or better. I can be competing against someone else even when that person doesn't know it. Because I hate to lose, I might get angry, upset. It does not matter if others think the contest is important. If I am doing it, I want to be number one. Others look to me for the motivation to win.    </p>

    <h3 class="strengths">Relating</h3>
    <p>I like to start friendships and keep them for a long time-maybe even my whole life. I widen the circle of friends for myself and others.There are many ways to be good at relating. I might easily meet new people, learn their names, and make friends very quickly wherever I go. I might take time to make friends, but be good at building long-lasting friendships. I might do both. I make friends quickly, people probably view you as happy, outgoing, and instantly likeable. I would rather spend time with a small group of friends talking, laughing, or just being together, these friends might see me as a best friend they can trust and talk to.</p>

    <h3 class="strengths">Confidence</h3>
    <p>I believe in myself and what I can do. This helps my take on challenges because I feel sure that I can succeed. Because I am confident, I am able to do things that others may not want to try. Knowing that I am a unique and special person in the world gives me the power to be who I am. I don't have to be like everybody else, and I don't have to follow the crowd. Even when I don't feel it, other people may see me as brave because I will speak up even if no one else will. I am sure enough of my opinions that I will take a stand for them. It is great to believe in what I can do because this belief helps me do more in my life.</p>
